def : A component is a reuable piece of UI (user interface)

1.reuable code
2.easy to manage 
3.organized structure 
4.faster development 
5.easy debugging 

Each Component should start with capital letter

2 types of components 

1. Class Component 
2. functional component 

class : blue print of an object 
syntax:
class classname{

}

in jsx if developer wants to use class selector then they have to use className 

inheritance : inheriting the properties from one class to another class
render : used to access the react class component 

functions : block of code which is used to do some tasks and it will be executed when we are calling it explicitly 
function functionName(){
    
}

functions: state less components => statefull => useState()
a=90
a+=1 => 91 =>react 18=> Hooks 
import module_name from ' '
import {useState} from 'react'

Syntax:
const[count , setCount]=useState(0);


class components : state full component default 
a=90
a+=1 =>91


State Full => handle its own state 
1. Manages its own state 
2. can change data and re-render UI 
3. uses useState() =>(function )


Hooks :
1.useState : to manage states with the help of function 
2.useEffect : react hook used to handle side effect in functonal component 
where to use :
API calls
localStorage Operation 
Timer(setTimeout , setInterval)
Event Listeners
DOM updates 

1.useEffect with no dependency
useEffect(()=>{

})
i. Fast render 
ii. every re-render 

2.useEffect with Dependency Array 
useEffect(()=>{

},[count]);
when does it runs :
i. first render 
ii.whenever count change 

usecases:
Recalculation 
sync data 

3.useEffect with empty dependency array 
useEffect(()=>{

},[]);
i. only first render 

usecases: 
API calls 
Initializing the data
